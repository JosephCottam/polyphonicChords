d3EnhancedChords
================

A more flexible chord-diagram layout for d3.

Pulled from [gghh](https://github.com/gghh/d3/blob/master/d3.js) and turned into a 
standalone layout function.  The actual interface is described in [a blog post](http://www.gghh.name/dibtp/?p=277).

This library has been used for experiments with chords in undirected graphs.
